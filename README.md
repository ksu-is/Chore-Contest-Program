# Chore-Contest-Program
A program with two parts. Part 1: chore counter. Prints ranked list of chores completed. Part 2: prize pool. Uses part 1 to make a pool from which a name will be selected at random. 

The program will run a chore contest. The ideal user of this program will be a family and/or household. 
It can make it easier for parents to keep track of kids doing chores and give incentive for the kids to do the chores. The program will have two parts: the chore counter and the prize pool. 
The chore counter will keep a record of how many people did how many of each type of chore. When this program is run, it will display the ranking of chores completed (i.e., 1st place with ## of chores was ___ 2nd place with ## of chores was ___...). 
Example of print-out from program:
Rank:
1st place with 7 chores was Sally.
2nd place with 4 chores was Bob.
3rd place with 3 chores was Susie.

The first part of the program will also have an option to print a list of how many chores of what type each person completed. If parents and/or the household wants to reward or pay people based on the number of chores or type of chores completed, this will make the task much easier. 
Example of print-out from program:
Name: Number completed
Chore: Litterboxes
Bob: 4
Sally: 2
Susie: 1

Chore: Dishes
Bob: 0
Sally: 5
Susie: 2

The program will then enter each person into the prize pool. The person in first place will receive as many entries as there were people in the chore contest. The second will receive one less than the first, and so on. The program will print how many entries into the prize pool each person will receive.
Example of print-out from program:
Bob entries into the prize pool: 2
Sally entries into the prize pool: 3
Susie entries into the prize pool: 1

This will be the bridge between the first part of the program and the second. The first should be able to be run as many times as desired while still adding to the second part until the prize pool is reset.
Part two of the program will be the prize pool. This part of the program will randomly draw one name from the prize pool. It will display the name so that person can receive a prize (from the parent or household). 
At any time, the user can choose to empty out the prize pool to reset it. If they do not reset it, the names will remain in the prize pool even after a name has been drawn. It will be up to the user whether they wish to start fresh every time or keep building.
